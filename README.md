# `node-modules`

> ðŸ§ª An experimental monorepo for `@guardian/*` NPM packages.

This repo is intended to make it as easy as possible to develop and update packages in accordance with [the Guardian's recommendations](https://github.com/guardian/recommendations/blob/main/npm-packages.md).

## Packages

<!-- START LIST_PACKAGES -->

    -   A simple test module.
-   [`@guardian/foo-react`](https://github.com/guardian/node-modules/tree/main/packages/foo-react)
    -   A simple test module with react.
-   [`@guardian/pkgu`](https://github.com/guardian/node-modules/tree/main/packages/pkgu)
    -   Automatically build `@guardian` packages for publishing to NPM in line with our recommendations.

## Adding a package

ðŸš§ _It's not ready for new packages yet, but when it is..._

Packages only need to worry about what they do â€“ everything else is managed by the project.

> 1. Create a directory in `./packages`
> 2. Add a `package.json`, `README.md` and `src/index.ts`
> 3. Run `make verify-packages`
>
> You now have a minimal but verifiable, publishable package.

### Workflows

The following workflows are pre-configured:

-   [x] Node version management
-   [x] NPM package management
-   [x] TypeScript configuration
-   [x] Eslint configuration
-   [x] Testing (using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/))
-   [x] Bundling (using `@guardian/pkgu` â€“Â a member of this project)
-   [ ] Versioning (using [changesets](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets))
-   [ ] Publishing (using [changesets](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets))

## Development

#### _tl;dr_

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `make dev`

#### In more depth...

Project tasks are defined in the `npm-scripts` of the root `package.json` (`build`, `test` etc).

Human-optimised versions are defined in the [`makefile`](./Makefile), which wraps the `npm-scripts` in fast-running admin tasks that catch common footguns while developing (node version, up-to-date deps etc).

_Think of the `makefile` as workflows for People Actions ([GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) for people)..._

Run them from the terminal using `make`:

-   `make dev` run the dev server and test suite in watch mode
-   `make validate` run tests, lint code and check types. They can also be run individually:
    -   `make lint` run eslint over all source code
    -   `make test` run all tests
    -   `make tsc` check all typescript compiles
-   `make fix` try to automatically fix any validation errors
-   `make build` build all packages
-   `make changeset` create a new changeset
-   `make bump` bump all updated packages
-   `make publish` publish all updated packages

_Run `make help` to see the full list of commands in the terminal._

#### Project requirements

Node version, package manager, NPM dependencies etc are automatically managed by the `make` tasks â€“Â you can use the commands above without worrying about them.

_You'll be prompted if you need to install anything._

### Advanced

Behind the scenes, the project is a [pnpm workspace](https://pnpm.io/workspaces).

If you need to do more than the tasks defined above â€“Â for example, adding a dependency to your package or managing CI â€“Â you should use `pnpm` directly.

See [the pnpm docs](https://pnpm.io) for full information.

## Releasing

Versioning and releasing of updated packages is managed with [changesets](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets).

Make sure you understand [how changesets work](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/blob/main/docs/detailed-explanation.md) before starting a new release.

```bash
# generate a new changeset
$ make changeset

# version-bump updated packages
$ make bump

# push the new versions to NPM
$ make release
```
